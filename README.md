# RSAEncryption
RSA Encryption Project

A three part project based on textbook RSA encryption. 
Part one allows users to test a number for primality using Fermat's primality test, where the user specifies the number of tests wanted. 
Part two generates a random prime number for the user, where the user specifies the size of the number in bits, and the number of times to be tested for primality using Fermat's primality test.
Part three performs textbook RSA encryption on a message input by the user, shows user the keys involved, encrypted form of the message, and decrypts the message. It allows for the user to specify N-bit size primes to be used for key creation, and the number of times to be tested for primality in Fermat's primality test. No padding is done on messages, shouldn't be use for real world purposes.

To Run: input "python Driver.py" in bash console while in source folder

Options:

1- Check number for primality

2- Generate random prime of specified size

3- RSA encryption of given message

4- Quit
